# azure-cellular-demo

NOTES:
* need parallel builds on azure pipelines
* building with .net8 will cause a bunch of warnings? stick with .net 6?
* if doing npm install to get a fixed version of cdktf, need to update csproj to exclude nodemodules
* need an azure devops PAT
* need to install azure pipelines github app, and maybe cancel out when it starts trying to connect to a pipeline
* need to have a github PAT
